# qotp - Qt-Based OTP Library

`qotp` is a Qt-based library providing HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) generation functionality as per [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226). It's designed to be easy to use in any Qt application, offering both standard HOTP and convenient wrappers for HOTP generation using Base32 and Base64 encoded secrets.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🚀 HOTP Generation | Implements the HMAC-Based One-Time Password algorithm as specified in [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226). |
| ❗ Convenience Wrappers | Provides functions for generating HOTP using Base32 or Base64 encoded secrets, making integration easier. |
| 🤌 Qt Integration | Seamlessly integrates with Qt applications, leveraging Qt data types and functionalities for a native feel. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Qt 6.x
- CMake 3.20 or higher (for building the project)

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/svnscha/qotp.git
cd qotp
```

2. Build with CMake
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

## Usage
Using `qotp` is straightforward and intuitive. For detailed function descriptions and parameters, please refer to the documentation in `libqotp/hotp.h`.

Below is an example demonstrating how to generate an HOTP value, taken from unit tests:

```cpp
void test_match_rfc()
{
    const auto key = QByteArrayView("12345678901234567890");
    QCOMPARE(libqotp::hotp(key, 0), QLatin1String("755224"));
    ...
}
```

This snippet shows how to generate an HOTP code using a predefined secret key and a counter value. It's a simple illustration of the library's core functionality in action.


## Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following steps:

1. Configure the project with testing enabled:
```
cmake -DWITH_TESTING=ON ..
```

2. Build and run the tests:
```
make
ctest
```
